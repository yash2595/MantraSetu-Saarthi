# Enterprise AI Intelligence Validation & Functional Certification v1.0

Repository: MantraSetu-AI-Backend
Date: 2026-08-04

## Final Status

**AI PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL**

Reason: Core implemented capabilities were executed with runtime evidence and most subsystem suites passed, but the full certification matrix still contains items that were not run as true end-to-end production workflows, especially real browser login/upload/download flows and real audio STT/TTS quality measurement.

## Evidence Summary

- Live OpenRouter benchmark executed successfully for 50 prompts.
- Conversation, memory, RAG, prompt runtime, navigation, workflow, voice, API, bootstrap, and production-go-live suites passed.
- Runtime bugs were fixed during validation:
  - conversation telemetry syntax error
  - navigation context builder variable error
  - conversation policy mismatch for puja booking flow
  - core import cycle affecting voice stack
  - AI orchestrator compatibility alias for voice test mocks

## Phase Results

| Phase | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Intent Detection Validation | PASS | Conversation foundation tests passed; intent, entity, multi-intent, fallback, and confidence logic executed. |
| 2. Conversation Intelligence | PASS | Multi-turn conversation flow passed after fix; session/context/history/correct resolution verified by tests. |
| 3. Memory Validation | PASS | Memory framework tests passed. |
| 4. RAG Validation | PASS | Knowledge RAG tests passed. |
| 5. Prompt Pipeline | PASS | Prompt runtime suite passed. |
| 6. LLM Quality | PASS | 50 live prompts executed against OpenRouter with 100% JSON parse rate and 100% intent accuracy. |
| 7. Tool Calling | PASS | Tool framework tests passed. |
| 8. Navigation Intelligence | PASS | Navigation suites passed after fixing context assembly. |
| 9. Browser Automation | PARTIAL | Browser platform suite passed, but not all requested real-world browser actions were executed as production workflows. |
| 10. Voice Intelligence | PARTIAL | Voice framework suites passed, but real audio STT/TTS quality measurement was not executed. |
| 11. Workflow Intelligence | PASS | Workflow studio and business workflow suites passed. |
| 12. AI Failure Testing | PARTIAL | Some failure modes were exercised via tests; not every injected failure scenario in the matrix was run end-to-end. |
| 13. AI Performance | PASS | Live 50-prompt benchmark captured latency, token, and cost metrics. |
| 14. Final AI Certification | PARTIAL | Most implemented capabilities were proven, but not every requested matrix item had full runtime evidence. |

## Notable Runtime Metrics

### LLM Benchmark

- Total prompts: 50
- JSON parse rate: 1.0
- Intent accuracy: 1.0
- Multi-intent accuracy: 1.0
- Unknown-intent accuracy: 1.0
- Average latency: 2823.89 ms
- P95 latency: 4336.58 ms
- Average tokens: 185.22
- Total cost: 0.00347804
- Average cost per prompt: 0.00006956

### Phase 13 Performance Harness

- Intent Time: 0.28 ms
- Prompt Time: 0.04 ms
- LLM Time: 866.70 ms
- RAG Time: 0.03 ms
- Navigation Time: 2.09 ms
- Tool Time: 0.30 ms
- Workflow Time: 0.04 ms
- Total AI Latency: 866.70 ms

Notes:

- RAG benchmark query returned 0 documents and 2 citations from the local knowledge manager.
- LLM latency here reflects a single live OpenRouter request, while the 50-prompt benchmark remains the broader quality/performance evidence set.

## Conclusion

The AI stack is not a stub: implemented capabilities were executed with live or unit/integration runtime evidence. However, the full certification bar you requested is stricter than the evidence available here, so the safest status remains **AI PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL**.
